        <p>What is a Progressive Web App? <br></br>
            PWAs are web apps developed using a number of specific technologies and standard patterns to allow them to take advantage of both web and native app features. For example, web apps are more discoverable â€” it's a lot easier and faster to visit a website
            than install an application, and you can also share web apps via a link. On the other hand, native apps are better integrated with the operating system and therefore offer a more seamless experience for the users. You can install a native
            app so that it works offline, and users love tapping their homescreen icons to easily access their favorite apps, rather than navigating to it using a browser.
